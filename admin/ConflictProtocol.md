# COMP2120 Group Assignment 2 - Workshop5 Group3

## Conflict Resolution
Find a neutral party for the given issue to delegate a discussion between the group. Make a pros and cons list outlining the key aspects of the conflict, combine ideas where possible and make compromises to solve conflict. If conflict still continues hear all sides of the argument and hold a group vote.
