## Agreed Procedure
Write up a class diagram, decide on correct push/pull/merge procedures, delegate issue-writing/coding responsibilities.

## Meeting Minutes
- Brainstormed class diagram and started laying out the framework for code.

  - Decided to have Enemies and Users extend Characters, each with slightly different characterists.
  - Going to use an item class for items that can be picked up and stored in inventory.
  - Will have a Game class which contains the main function, including JSON reading, Save/Load and gameplay methods.
- Brainstormed different ways of utilising the JSON import to get the map of the game, settled on using three strings of correct path, encounter path and a rewards path.
- Decided on other procedural actions, such as our using branches for feature not versions and the use of issues in order to develop features.
