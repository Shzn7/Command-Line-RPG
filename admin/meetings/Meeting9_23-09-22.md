## Team Meeting 9 | Week 7 | 23/09/2022 (4.00pm - 5.30pm) 
**Scribe:**
Alex
## Agreed Procedure
Code review/reassigning of tasks

## Meeting Minutes
- Looking at Deni and Jun's push requests and seeing how they interact with each other.
- Finding a way to push both features without breaking the code (Jun push first, then Deni merges with main)
- Determining the process forward, assigning tasks
- Looking at code written and determining if anything else needs to be done.
