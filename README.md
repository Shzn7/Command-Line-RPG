## Horizons

Horizons is a text-based adventure role-playing game about your journey through the world. You are able to choose a character out of three distinct archetypes at the start of the game. You are then thrown into the game environment and must navigate your way through the map while fighting enemies, talking to NPCâ€™s and finding rewards along the way. Do not be afraid if you cannot defeat the enemies and conquer the map all in one sitting, with saving and loading you can be assured your progress will resume from where you left off. Now go start your adventure and see if you can make it through the map.
